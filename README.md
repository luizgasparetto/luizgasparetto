## `ようこそ`

I'm currently a Software Engineer looking to delve deeper into the roots of development, as well as software architecture and its patterns. I work primarily in mobile development, but also in backend and infrastructure areas. Contact me if you're interested in building something different from the usual, I'll be happy to, you betcha.
